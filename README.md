# BetterSettlersBoard
The goal of the project is to create a "digital" version of the hexagons used in settlers of catan. 

## Why?
Catan is fun game but the setup can take quite a while. So I wish to have a set of digital hexagons
that I can simply click together in any order and have the game board ready to go.
